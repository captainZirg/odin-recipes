        <p>What’s your favorite kind of pizza? For me, nothing beats my sweet & salty apple gorgonzola pizza. But this BBQ chicken pizza is in close 2nd place! Sweet BBQ sauce, chopped chicken, red onions, a dash of cilantro, and tons of cheese.</p>

        <h2>How to make:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> <strong>BBQ Sauce:</strong> My husband isn’t a fan of too much BBQ sauce, but I love sauce in each bite. The middle ground is about 1/3 cup of BBQ sauce. Add more if you love extra sauce. </li>
            <li> <strong>Chicken:</strong> You need 1 cup of chopped cooked chicken. You can buy pre-cooked chicken or pick up a rotisserie chicken. Shred it, then use as the pizza topping. Or you can cook your own chicken for the BBQ chicken pizza. 1 skinless boneless chicken breast is plenty. Whichever you use, toss the cooked chicken in a little BBQ sauce right before layering it on top of the pizza; doing so prevents the cooked chicken from drying out. </li>
            <li> <strong>Cheese:</strong> For best flavor, let’s use TWO cheeses. Shredded mozzarella for that classic pizza flavor and smoked gouda for deep smoky flavor. Smoked gouda pairs wonderfully with the sweet BBQ sauce and fresh cilantro! If you don’t want to make the extra trip to the store, skip the gouda and just use mozzarella.</li>
            <li> <strong>Red Onion:</strong> Sharp red onion adds so much flavor to each bite. Not a fan of onion? Leave it off.</li>
