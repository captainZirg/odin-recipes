            <h2>How to Make this Chicken Gyro Recipe</h2>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>First, make the marinade. Combine the Greek yogurt with garlic, spices, lemon juice and olive oil.  Mix with a spoon or whisk to make sure all is well-combined.</li>
                <li>Add chicken to the Greek yogurt marinade. Using a pair of tongs, toss chicken and make sure all the pieces are well-coated in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. (You can also do this step one night in advance and refrigerate overnight.)</li>
                <li>When you're ready, heat a little bit of extra virgin olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until the oil is just shimmering (don't let it smoke.) Add chicken (make sure you shake excess marinade off). Cook for 5 minutes on one side until nicely browned, then turn over and cook another 5 minutes or until chicken is fully cooked. (Resist disturbing the chicken as it cooks, you want a great color on these tenders!)</li>
                <li>Assemble the yummy gyros! Warm your pitas and spread some mean homemade tztaziki sauce. Add a couple pieces of your beautiful Greek chicken and top with the sliced veggies and olives. Enjoy!</li>
