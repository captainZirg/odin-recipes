                        A beautiful, juicy, tender, double cheeseburger. I'll share my tips for making the perfect burger (super-easy, no special tools or ingredients).
                A brilliant Friday night treat with all the toppings!

                <h2>What do we need to make the best burgers?</h2>
                <p>The burger patties are the absolute simplest to make - <strong>minced beef, salt and pepper</strong>  - you don't need anything else! </p>
                <p>Go with finely-ground minced beef (regular, good-quality supermarket mince in the packet is fine. I've used Sainbury's, Ocado, Tesco and Morrisons, and they're all good). I sometimes find that minced beef from the butchers is less finely ground, and no-one wants chewy bits or gristle in their burgers. So if you buy from the butchers, ask them to finely grind or double grind it.</p>
                <p>It's really important to go with 20% fat minced beef. Don't be tempted with lean 12% fat or extra lean 5% fat beef. You'll end up with dry, chewy burgers. The extra fat in 20% fat beef will not only make the burger more juicy, but it will also add extra flavour, and will help to ensure perfectly browned, slightly crispy edges.</p>
                <p>No need to add binders - like egg or breadcrumbs. These will not only effect the flavour of the burger, but they will make the structure 'tighter' or more dense. We want soft tenderness!</p>

                <h2>How to make it</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Take the minced beef out of the refrigerator an hour before you want to use it. Like steak, it's better to have minced beef that's closer to room temperature, rather than very cold. This will ensure the inside of the burger is hot at the same time the outside is cooked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Form the minced beef into balls and squash flat into patties.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sprinkle on salt and pepper right before cooking the burgers. Salt can draw out moisture from the meat and we want to keep that moisture in.
                    </li>
                    <li>Place the burgers on a hot griddle that's been brushed with oil, and cook for about 3 minutes, until browned.</li>
                    <li>Turn the burgers over and place a slice of cheese on top. Cook for a further 1-3 minutes, until browned on the second side, then remove from the griddle and allow to rest for a couple of minutes.</li>
                    <li>Stack the burgers up on toasted brioche buns with lettuce, tomato, onions and burger sauce and serve.</li>
                </ul>
